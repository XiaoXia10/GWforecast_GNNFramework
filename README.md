# Graph neural network framework for spatio-temporal grooundwater level forecasting

By: Xiao Xia Liang, Maxime Claprood, Erwan Gloaguen, Daniel Paradis and Thomas BÃ©raud

Framework is designed for monintoring and pumping well groundwater level forecasting.
Data used for training the framework for this mauscript is simulated from a FEFLOW hydrogeological model.
Field measured data can also be used to train this network

All scripts and data are included here.
