# Graph neural network framework for spatio-temporal groundwater level forecasting

By: Xiao Xia Liang, Maxime Claprood, Erwan Gloaguen, Daniel Paradis and Thomas BÃ©raud

Framework is designed for monintoring and pumping well groundwater level forecasting.
Data used for training the framework for this mauscript is simulated from a FEFLOW hydrogeological model.
Field measured data can also be used to train this network

The GNN model used contains 2 GCN and 2 LSTM layers followed by a dropout layer and a dense layer. The GNN model is packaged by [StellarGraph](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). The model was inspired by [Zhao et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05320)
